Description: LBNL Node Health Check (NHC)   
 This package contains the Warewulf Node Health Check system.
 .
 SLURM (and other resource managers) allow for the execution of a
 script to determine if a node is "healthy" or "unhealthy" and
 potentially mark unhealthy nodes as unavailable.  The scripts
 contained in this package provide a flexible, extensible mechanism for
 collecting health checks to be run on your cluster and specifying
 which checks should be run on which nodes. Based on:
